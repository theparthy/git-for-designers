## What is Git
Git is a distributed version-control system for code.

Descriptive but not very helpful, right? Let me tell you a true story then:

> You’re working on a small website. You’ve been trying to get that sticky footer right for a whole hour and somehow only managed to make it worse in the process. It’s 2AM. You hate CSS and is currently in the process of re-thinking your life choices. Screw this, let’s go back to the previous version from 3 hours ago and watch some Netflix.

> Oh wait.
